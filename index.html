      <h1> I know nothing about hacking </h1>
      <p> 
        I have been coding for some weeks now.
        Not nearly enough to know anything about hacking, especially since that's not what I'm learning.
        Yet, with everything I've learnt, I still can code some menacing code...
      </p>

      <h2> <em>Menacing</em> </h2>
      <p> 
        What's a menacing code? 
        Who knows. Not me, for sure. 
        But if I had to give  definition, it would be 'a code that scares people'. 
        Simple, right? There is no need to be a pro hacker for a code to scare people. 
        I can simply forget indents, put everything on the same line, give random variable names and the likes. 
        Isn't my code menacing if nobody wants to see it?
      </p>

      <h3> Conclusion </h3>
      <p>
        There's no need to have any particular skill to destroy things.
        There's no need to try particularly hard to incure negative emotions.
        My code is most <strong><em> menacing </em></strong> when I try as little as possible.
